# hello-world
My demo repository for educating others
In this repository we'll introduce you to options trading strategies empowered by Python.
We'll First look at how to import data from public options libraries.
Then, we'll look at how to apply Python data science libraries to predict likelihoods of options expiring worthless/in the money.
Finally, we'll implement some demo screens that allow you to focus on options with the highest "expected value" returns (lowest liklihood of expiring in the money * highest time value).
Note that this repository will focus on sell-side strategies, but could be modified to also focus on long/buy-side options strategies.
